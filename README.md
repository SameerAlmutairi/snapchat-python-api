# snapchat-python-api
A python class that exposes SnapChat's private API

SnapChat's Backend API isn't documented for developers and the company has no current plans to allow 3rd-party applications, 
however their servers are still publically accessible at the right endpoints.

This class gives you programmatic access to the operations the mobile app performs.
e.g. Account Creation, logging into user accounts, adding friends, sending image or video snaps, posting stories, etc.

Snapchat is constantly updating, so the App Version Field needs to be updated to match whatever the most recent version is
in the app store.
